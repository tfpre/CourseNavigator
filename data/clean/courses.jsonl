Topics include processor microcoding and pipelining; cache microarchitecture and optimization; and network topology, routing, and flow control. The second half of the course delves into more advanced techniques and will enable students to understand how these three building blocks can be integrated to build a modern shared-memory multicore system. Topics include superscalar execution, branch prediction, out-of-order execution, register renaming and memory disambiguation; VLIW, vector, and multithreaded processors; memory protection, translation, and virtualization; and memory synchronization, consistency, and coherence.

The T/R lectures are shared with an undergraduate class, CS 4414 but the (required) recitation sections cover content that the CS 4414 students will not see and the last of the multi-stage projects will focus on cloud AI and ML scenarios, while the last of the CS 4414 projects focuses on a single-computer scenario. Thus even though you will overlap with Cornell seniors (and some juniors) in the lecture hall, you will also gain additional perspective and knowledge in recitation and will be doing a more ambitious style of project that comes very close to what companies are undertaking to integrate AI into their cloud solutions. The CS 4414 students will have a separate discussion board than you, and although you do take the same prelim exams, your grading is more focused on projects (25% exams, 75% projects, in contrast to the 50-50 balance for CS 4414).\n\nCS 5416 starts by exposing students to programming applications at the systems level and to the operating systems abstractions that these applications depend on. It then builds on this foundation to look at systems issues that shape the performance and reliability of modern ML and AI applications, such as “chat bots” and question-answering AIs. We do not expect students to learn how these ML and AI tools work, in a mathematical sense. Instead our focus is on how they execute, where components run and how they talk one another, how they interact with big-data storage, and how they leverage accelerators such as GPU. CS 4414 students who attend these cloud-computing and ML lectures won’t be using the material in their projects, whereas CS 5416 students will gain hands-on experience working with and optimizing ML and AI applications that have this form.

Rather than imagining what algorithmic fairness should look like in an ideal world, we will explore what the research tells us it looks like today, and what can be done given the incentives and practical constraints of the world we are in. For instance, the “silver bullets” of algorithmic fairness are often abstract calls made to increase participation, transparency, and regulation. However, each approach faces difficulties in practice. In an era where algorithmic fairness faces resistance from many fronts, it is critical that we foreground concrete proposals in addition to abstract ideals. In doing so, we’ll also discuss the consequences of taking on a perspective that might be overly reformist at the expense of radical re-imagining, and think through whether complementarity exists.","prerequisite_text":"","units_min":3.0,"units_max":3.0,"roster":"FA25","meetings":[{"type":"SEM","days":["T","R"],"time_start":"10:10AM","time_end":"11:25AM","instructor":"aw877"}],"cross_listings":["INFO 6125"]}

We start with the basic quantities used to characterize circuit operation (like current, voltage, and power) and then enforce several physical laws to form the basis of our approach to circuit analysis. Networks comprising passive circuit elements such as resistors, inductors, and capacitors will be examined under constant dc, transient, and sinusoidal steady-state conditions. Active components including transistors and Op-Amps will be introduced and used to build simple amplifiers and switching power converters. Many of these ideas will be unified mathematically through the use of Laplace transforms and associated transfer functions. In the lab part of the course, we will learn how to use modern instruments to test circuits, and explore the concepts from lecture applied to real circuits. Finally, we will develop some simple modeling software in MATLAB to numerically predict the results from analysis and experiment.","prerequisite_text":"MATH 1920 or PHYS 1112.

Uses examples pulled broadly from core areas of physics: Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics, and Quantum Mechanics.  Focus is on algorithmic thinking, converting mathematical representations into practical algorithms, working with data, and drawing physical conclusions from numerical results.  Model problems will involve numerical quadratures, ordinary and partial differential equations, numerical linear algebra, event based simulations, and Monte Carlo techniques.  May include modern techniques, such as those drawn from machine learning and artificial intelligence.  Instruction will largely be in Julia, with computer labs integrated into lectures.  No prior experience with Julia is necessary, but students should have some experience with programming.  Graduate versions, PHYS 7680 and ASTRO 7690, require an additional project which is not required in the undergraduate version, PHYS 4480.","prerequisite_text":"","units_min":3.0,"units_max":3.0,"roster":"FA25","meetings":[{"type":"LEC","days":["T","R"],"time_start":"08:40AM","time_end":"09:55AM","instructor":"em256"}],"cross_listings":["ASTRO 7690","PHYS 4480"]}
