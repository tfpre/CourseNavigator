The second half of the course delves into more advanced techniques and will enable students to understand how these three building blocks can be integrated to build a modern shared-memory multicore system. Topics include superscalar execution, branch prediction, out-of-order execution, register renaming and memory disambiguation; VLIW, vector, and multithreaded processors; memory protection, translation, and virtualization; and memory synchronization, consistency, and coherence.

MATH 6520 is an introduction to geometry and topology from a differentiable viewpoint, suitable for beginning graduate students. The objects of study are manifolds and differentiable maps. The collection of all tangent vectors to a manifold forms the tangent bundle, and a section of the tangent bundle is a vector field. Alternatively, vector fields can be viewed as first-order differential operators. Students study flows of vector fields and prove the Frobenius integrability theorem. In the presence of a Riemannian metric, the notions of parallel transport, curvature, and geodesics are development. Students examine the tensor calculus and the exterior differential calculus and prove Stokes' theorem. If time permits, de Rham cohomology, Morse theory, or other optional topics are introduced.","prerequisite_text":"Prerequisites: advanced calculus, linear algebra (MATH 4310), point-set topology (MATH 4530).","prereq_ast":{"type":"PREREQUISITE","courses":["MATH 4310","MATH 4530"],"raw_text":"Prerequisites: advanced calculus, linear algebra (MATH 4310), point-set topology (MATH 4530).","metadata":{"has_permission_clause":false,"has_equivalent_clause":false,"is_recommended":false}},"prereq_confidence":0.7,"units_min":4,"units_max":4,"roster":"FA14","meetings":[{"type":"LEC","days":["M","W","F"],"time_start":"12:20PM","time_end":"01:10PM","location":"Malott Hall 224","instructor":"aeh11"}],"cross_listings":[]}
